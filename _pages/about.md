I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, NYU. I am working with [Prof. Laure Zanna](https://zanna-researchteam.github.io/) on improving air-sea flux parameterization in climate models, using a combination of observational data, high-fidelity numerical simulations, and data-driven methods. I am affiliated with Learning the Earth with Artificial Intelligence and Physics ([LEAP](https://leap.columbia.edu/)).

Previously I did my Ph.D. at Princeton University, advised by [Prof. Luc Deike](https://ldeike.princeton.edu). My thesis focuses on the dynamics of ocean surface waves in the context of air-sea interaction. 

In general, my research interests include fluid dynamics, waves, turbulence, ocean physics, climate modeling, and computational methods. Here is my [CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/CV-Wu-2022.pdf).

I am original from Huzhou, China. In my free time, I enjoy playing volleyball, making food, taking photos, and mostly recently learning about music theory.
